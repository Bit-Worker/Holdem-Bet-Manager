# Holdem-Bet-Manager
A command line program to handle Poker Texas Hold'em chips
Hello, this is a simple project I started to learn Swift (still a looong road...) :)
The program asks for players, stack and handles bets and pot splits. 
I know many things can be made better, I'd like advices on how by anyone interested, both in logic and architecture.
Hope this can be useful for someone (me too obviously...)!
